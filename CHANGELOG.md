# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-switcher will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Stdin Piping Support**: Pipe data into executable markdown scripts for Unix-style workflows
  - `echo '{"data": 1}' | ./analyze.md` - stdin content is prepended to prompt by default
  - `cat data.txt | ./process.md --stdin-position append` - optionally append instead
  - Enables chaining scripts: `./generate.md | ./format.md > output.txt`
- **`--stdin-position` Flag**: Control where piped input appears in the prompt
  - `prepend` (default): stdin content comes before the markdown file content
  - `append`: stdin content comes after the markdown file content
- **Automation Test Suite**: Validates all README script examples (`./test/automation/run_tests.sh`)
  - Tests shebang execution, stdin piping, pipeline chaining, shell integration
  - Also available as executable markdown: `./test/automation/run_tests.md`
- **Full Automation Mode**: Document `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` for unattended scripts
  - Enables AI scripts to run commands without interactive approval
  - Use in CI/CD pipelines and trusted automation environments

### Fixed
- **Pipe Output Pollution**: Console output (banners, `[Claude Switcher]` messages) no longer pollutes stdout when piping to files
  - Added `is_interactive()` TTY detection to suppress banners in non-interactive mode
  - All status messages now route to stderr instead of stdout
  - `./script.md > result.txt` now produces clean output without escape codes
- Banner and print functions redirected to stderr for proper Unix semantics

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **`claude-run` Unified Entry Point**: New command that combines provider switching and executable markdown
  - Interactive mode: `claude-run --aws --opus --resume` (equivalent to `claude-aws --opus --resume`)
  - Shebang mode: Executable markdown files with `#!/usr/bin/env claude-run`
  - Provider flags: `--aws`, `--vertex`, `--apikey`, `--azure`, `--vercel`, `--pro`
  - Model flags: `--opus`, `--sonnet`, `--haiku`, `--model <id>`
  - Full passthrough of all native `claude` flags
- **Executable Markdown**: Run AI prompts as scripts
  - Supports `#!/usr/bin/env claude-run` shebang
  - Multiple flags via `#!/usr/bin/env -S claude-run --aws --opus`
  - Works with `--output-format json` for scripting
- **Security Documentation**: Clear warnings about non-interactive mode risks
  - Trust model explanations (same as `claude -p`)
  - Guidance on `--dangerously-skip-permissions` appropriate usage

### Changed
- **README Restructure**: `claude-run` is now the primary recommended approach
  - Cleaner Quick Start section
  - Individual provider scripts (`claude-aws`, etc.) documented as secondary option
  - Added security warnings for shebang mode
- Setup output now highlights `claude-run` as recommended entry point

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Vercel AI Gateway Support**: New `claude-vercel` command to route Claude Code through Vercel's AI Gateway
  - Provides automatic failover (e.g., to AWS Bedrock)
  - Unified billing and spend management across all AI providers
  - Uses `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` per [rauchg's announcement](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2007556249437778419)
- Vercel-specific model identifiers: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4`, `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`
- New configuration options: `VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_URL`

## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fixes in `claude-pro` script**:
  - **Syntax Error (Line 40)**: Removed malformed backslash-quote causing "unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'" error
  - **Authentication Conflict**: Added missing `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to prevent "Auth conflict" warning
    - Now properly unsets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before launching Claude Code (matching pattern from other scripts)
    - Ensures only web authentication is active for Claude Pro/Max sessions
    - Environment variable is still saved and restored on exit
  - Script now passes bash syntax validation and runs without authentication conflicts
  - Thanks to Reddit user for reporting the initial syntax issue

## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-24
